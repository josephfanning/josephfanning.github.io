                            <p> Andrew Kerins, better known as Brother Walfrid, called for a meeting on November 6, 1887,
                            to establish a football team for the local area of the east end of Glasgow with the aim of raising funds for its struggling Irish families.
                            In a small back room in <a href="https://saintmarycalton.org.uk"> St Mary's Church hall </a>on Forbes street, 
                            those assembled there under Brother Walfrid's orders established a new football club for Glasgow. </p>

                            <p> On Monday, 28 May 1888, Celtic Football Club played its first-ever match, facing Glasgow outfit Rangers in a friendly. 
                            As Celtic were still in the process of securing a team for the new season 
                            - players' contracts were renewed annually in those days 
                            - the home side comprised of players still contracted to other clubs, including both Renton and Hibernian.  </p>

                            <p> In 1897 the club directors decided to bring Celtic in line with the developing professional game and they appointed a full-time team manager. 
                                They appointed 29-year-old Newry-born Willie Maley who guided Celtic to a league title in his first year in charge. 
                                Maley would manage Celtic for 43 years and lead them to 30 major trophies. 
                                Before the appointment of Willie Maley, Celtic would buy players from other clubs. 
                                It drained the club's finances and did not reflect on the community foundations of Celtic. 
                                Maley decided to recruit players from nearby schools and streets. 
                                An established club academy made sure that a parish sense of pride strung out through the team and its fans.
                                <b> Willie Maley is often known for his popular quote: My love for Celtic has been a craze. Without it my existence would be empty indeed. </b>  </p>

                            <p> In the early days of Celtic football,
                                fans of the club from different streets in Glasgow would travel to games on large horse-drawn brakes and they became known as <a href="https://www.thecelticwiki.com/legends-and-supporters/brake-clubs/"> <b> Brake Clubs.</b></a> 
                                They would carry big banners proclaiming their street or parish, along with a picture or name of a player from that area. 
                                This tradition continued on when the automobile replaced the horse and fans packed into buses with flags, banners, flutes, and bugles! 
                                They were usually heard before they were seen! </p>

                            <p> It was Aberdeen's first Scottish Cup final and the black and golds were well supported (before they played in red), 
                                but it was Celtic with goals from Johnny Crum and Willie Buchan who won the day. 
                                The crowd was given as 147,365 but in fact there were a lot more than that at Hampden to see Celtic beat Aberdeen 2-1 
                                to win the Cup for the 15th time on this day, 24 April 1937. This was a European club record for the highest attendance 
                                ever at a football match. This marks the most attended Celtic match ever. A close second was a 1938 Scottish league game played against Rangers FC at Celtic's home ground; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_Park">Celtic Park</a></p>
