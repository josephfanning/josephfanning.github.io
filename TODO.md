To do for Web CW:

Comment javascript code for each script file
Fix code so its easier to understand (particularly CSS styling!)
Properly sort out CSS code into different files so its more manageable
Test finished product on different sites and screens
Fix background being weird on different pages. e.g when the gradient background cuts off abruptly
