To do for Web CW:

• Fix code so its easier to understand (particularly CSS styling!)<br>
• Test finished product on different sites and screenshot different pages etc<br>
• Fix background being weird on different pages. e.g when the gradient background cuts off abruptly<br>
• start and complete report<br>
• test each site and script files<br>
• change totalScore on celticQuiz.html to a var so its not block-scoped<br>
• Comment code for second tab on teamTracker.html<br>
